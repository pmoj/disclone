### Cloning Discord: A Web Development Practice Project

Welcome to our Discord clone project! Our aim is to hone our web development skills by creating a replica of the popular communication platform, Discord.

**Project Overview**

This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with various technologies, frameworks, and design patterns commonly used in web development. By emulating Discord's features and functionalities, we aspire to deepen our understanding of:

- Frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Backend development (Python, Django, PostgreSQL)
- Real-time communication (WebSockets, Channels)
- User authentication and authorization
- Responsive design and user experience optimization
